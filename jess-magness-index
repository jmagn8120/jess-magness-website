	<div id="student"><h2>STUDENT</h2>
	<p>Currently working towards Master's of Science in Information Systems. The degree program is specialized for professionals who wish to broaden and formalize their knowledge in the field of information technology.<br>
	Relevant Coursework includes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Software Development</strong> - I have completed weekly development exercises using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I have been able to increase my skills in back-end programming to build customized web pages, websites and applications. I have been able to customize pages using CSS and build and validate forms using JavaScript. Course material also teaches the complexities of web development and how to overcome many of the prevalent barriers in the field.</li>
		<li><strong>Intro to Database Management</strong> - Learning fundamental concepts associated with database management systems, analyzing data management problems (e.g., assess the information needs of a business), designing databases that address those problems using industry-standard methodologies, implementing those designs using popular commercial-grade database software packages, developing applications that interact with databases using SQL.</li>
		<li><strong>Advanced Database Management</strong> - Examines both traditional database systems and recent advances in database systems. Topics include formal treatment of normalization and denormalization, extended entity-relationship models, advanced query processing techniques, query optimization, physical database design and indexing, and object-oriented database systems.</li> 
		<li><strong>Healthcare Informatics</strong> - Healthcare Informatics The course presents an overview of all aspects of healthcare informatics, including medical, nursing and bioinformatics. It provides an introduction to the applications of information systems in a variety of healthcare environments, including education, research and clinical settings. It includes extensive reading and critical discussion of relevant professional research literature.</li>
	</ul></p></div><br>
	
	<div id="intern"><p><h2>OPEN DATA INTERN</h2><p>Work with the Data Services Team at OIT to make the city's data more transparent and accessible. This involved interfacing with a number of City Departments (Licenses and Inspections, Animal Control, Board of Ethics and the City Commissioner's Office) to analyze their creation and useage of data and suggesting ways to optimize their data processes. This also resulted in the City's Data Inventory, which keeps track of all the data sets being created within the city. 
	Collect data from the city's agencies and departments. Run queries to access business insight for departments and provide visualizations 
	of data. Take part in cleaning and organizing data to increase accessibility and its ability to be machine-readable. I have used 
	MySQL, MS Access, XML, and T-SQL to make sure that the city's data is current. Writing, editing, and maintaining markup for external sites. I also provide research for trends in database 
	management, analytics and visualizations.</p></div><br>
	
	<div id="webdev"><p><h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</h2><p>Takes part in Code For Philly's weekly meet up to provide valuable 
	apps to the people of Philadelphia. OpenDisclosure aims to be a web portal that will provide information on candidates in 
	Philadelphia's 2015 primary election. This project utilizes Bootstrap, JavaScript, Angular.JS and querying and manipulating 
	data from the Philadelphia Board of Ethics.</br></br>
	Also works with a team on grademypc.com, which is in the process of developing a web application that scans, displays and 
	grades a computer's downloaded applications. This project involves ideation with team members, prototyping and building out 
	the application and its database. This application uses Python and PHP/MySQL.
